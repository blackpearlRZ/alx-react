  <h1>HTML Webpack Plugin</h1>
  <p>Plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your bundles</p>
</div>

<h2 align="center">Install</h2>

<h3>Webpack 5</h3>

```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin
```

<h3>Webpack 4</h3>

```bash
  npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin@4
```

```bash
  yarn add --dev html-webpack-plugin@4
```

This is a [webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your `webpack` bundles. This is especially useful for `webpack` bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin generate an HTML file for you, supply
your own template using `lodash` templates or use your own loader.

Thanks for supporting the ongoing improvements to the html-webpack-plugin!

<h2 align="center">Zero Config</h2>

The `html-webpack-plugin` works without configuration.  
It's a great addition to the [⚙️ webpack-config-plugins](https://github.com/namics/webpack-config-plugins/blob/master/README.md#zero-config-webpack-dev-server-example).

<h2 align="center">Plugins</h2>

The `html-webpack-plugin` provides [hooks](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#events) to extend it to your needs. There are already some really powerful plugins which can be integrated with zero configuration

- [webpack-subresource-integrity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-subresource-integrity) for enhanced asset security
- [appcache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lettertwo/appcache-webpack-plugin) for iOS and Android offline usage
- [favicons-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/favicons-webpack-plugin) which generates favicons and icons for iOS, Android and desktop browsers
- [html-webpack-harddisk-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-harddisk-plugin) can be used to always write to disk the html file, useful when webpack-dev-server / HMR are being used
- [html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin](https://github.com/thegc/html-webpack-inline-svg-plugin) to inline SVGs in the resulting HTML file.
- [html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jamesjieye/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) for excluding assets using regular expressions
- [html-webpack-include-assets-plugin](https://github.com/jharris4/html-webpack-include-assets-plugin) for including lists of js or css file paths (such as those copied by the copy-webpack-plugin).
- [html-webpack-injector](https://github.com/thearchitgarg/html-webpack-injector) to inject chunks in `head` or `body` (different locations ) of same html document.
- [resource-hints-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/resource-hints-webpack-plugin) to add resource hints for faster initial page loads using `<link rel='preload'>` and `<link rel='prefetch'>`
- [link-media-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/yaycmyk/link-media-html-webpack-plugin) allows for injected stylesheet `<link />` tags to have their media attribute set automatically; useful for providing specific desktop/mobile/print etc. stylesheets that the browser will conditionally download
- [html-webpack-inline-style-plugin](https://github.com/djaax/html-webpack-inline-style-plugin) for inlining styles to HTML elements using [juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice). Useful for email generation automatisation.
- [html-webpack-exclude-empty-assets-plugin](https://github.com/KnisterPeter/html-webpack-exclude-empty-assets-plugin) removes empty assets from being added to the html. This fixes some problems with extract-text-plugin with webpack 4.
- [webpack-concat-plugin](https://github.com/hxlniada/webpack-concat-plugin) for concat and uglify files that needn't to be webpack bundles(for legacy files) and inject to html-webpack-plugin.
- [html-webpack-link-type-plugin](https://github.com/steadyapp/html-webpack-link-type-plugin) adds a configurable mimetype to resources injected as links (such as adding type="text/css" to external stylesheets) for compatibility with "strict mode".
- [csp-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/slackhq/csp-html-webpack-plugin) to add [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) meta tags to the HTML output
- [strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/google/strict-csp/tree/main/strict-csp-html-webpack-plugin) to add a [**strict** Content-Security-Policy (CSP)](https://web.dev) as a `meta` tag to the HTML output. A strict CSP is specifically efficient against XSS attacks.
- [webpack-nomodule-plugin](https://github.com/swimmadude66/webpack-nomodule-plugin) allows you to add a `nomodule` attribute to specific injected scripts, which prevents the scripts from being loaded by newer browsers. Good for limiting loads of polyfills.
- [html-webpack-skip-assets-plugin](https://github.com/swimmadude66/html-webpack-skip-assets-plugin) Skip adding certain output files to the html file. Built as a drop-in replacement for [html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) and works with newer [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) versions
- [html-webpack-inject-preload](https://github.com/principalstudio/html-webpack-inject-preload) allows to add preload links &lt;link rel='preload'> anywhere you want.
- [inject-body-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Jaid/inject-body-webpack-plugin) is a simple method of injecting a custom HTML string into the body.
- [html-webpack-plugin-django](https://github.com/TommasoAmici/html-webpack-plugin-django) a Webpack plugin to inject Django static tags.
- [html-webpack-inject-attributes-plugin](https://github.com/dyw934854565/html-webpack-inject-attributes-plugin) add extra attributes to inject assetTags.
- [js-entry-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/liam61/html-webpack-plugin) creates webpack bundles into your js entry

<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>

The plugin will generate an HTML5 file for you that includes all your `webpack`
bundles in the head using `script` tags. Just add the plugin to your `webpack`
config as follows:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  entry: "index.js",
  output: {
    path: __dirname + "/dist",
    filename: "index_bundle.js",
  },
  plugins: [new HtmlWebpackPlugin()],
};
```

This will generate a file `dist/index.html` containing the following

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Webpack App</title>
    <script defer src="index_bundle.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

If you have multiple `webpack` entry points, they will all be included with `script` tags in the generated HTML.

If you have any CSS assets in webpack's output (for example, CSS extracted with the [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin))
then these will be included with `<link>` tags in the HTML head.

If you have plugins that make use of it, `html-webpack-plugin` should be ordered first before any of the integrated Plugins.

<h2 align="center">Options</h2>

You can pass a hash of configuration options to `html-webpack-plugin`.
Allowed values are as follows:

Passing `true` will add it to the head/body depending on the `scriptLoading` option.
